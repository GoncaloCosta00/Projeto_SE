## A project for class Embedded Systems wich consist in a Smart City with a smart crosswalk, smart parking, smart lights and a weather station.

On the crosswalk, when the people will cross will be lit leds on the road in order to warn the drivers of the presence of people on the crosswalk. This previne run over.  
The smart parking shows the number of seats available.  
The smart lights only turn on when the brightness is below a certain value. The lights of the road will turn on gradually. This reduces unnecessary and excessive expenses.  
The weather station controls the temperature, humidity and air quality.   
Also, we have a sensor for garbage container wich monitors the percentage of use. If it almost full, will be sent a notification to the responsible person.
